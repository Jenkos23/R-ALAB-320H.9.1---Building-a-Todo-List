# Todo List Application

This is a simple **Todo List** application built using **React** and **Redux**. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, toggling completion, and deleting tasks. The app follows the principles of **React**'s component-based architecture and uses **Redux** for state management.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Users can add new todos to the list.
- **Complete Todo**: Mark todos as completed by checking a checkbox.
- **Delete Todo**: Delete todos once they are marked as completed. The delete button is disabled unless the todo is complete.
- **Edit Todo**: Edit the title of a todo item. While editing, the "Save" button appears to save changes.
- **New Todos at the Top**: New todos appear at the top of the list, with the oldest at the bottom.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management library for managing the todo list.
- **React-Redux**: Official React bindings for Redux.
- **React Strict Mode**: Helps identify potential issues in the application during development.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (preferably the latest stable version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

To start the app in development mode, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React development server, and the application should be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure

```
/src
  /redux
    /actions
      todoActions.js      # Action creators for todo operations (add, delete, toggle, edit)
    /reducers
      todoReducer.js      # Reducer to manage the todo list state
    store.js              # Redux store configuration
  /components
    App.js                # Main component rendering the todo list and managing state
  /index.js               # Entry point for the React app, including Redux Provider
  /index.css              # Global styles for the app
  /App.css                # Specific styles for the Todo List components
```

## How It Works

1. **React Component Structure**: The application is composed of a main `App` component that renders the todo list, handles input fields for adding new todos, and manages the state of each todo item (whether it's completed, being edited, etc.).
   
2. **Redux Store**: 
   - The state is managed using Redux, with actions to add, toggle completion, delete, and edit todos.
   - The `todoReducer.js` file handles the logic for updating the state based on the dispatched actions.

3. **React-Redux**: 
   - `useSelector` is used to access the current state (the list of todos) from Redux.
   - `useDispatch` is used to dispatch actions to the Redux store (like adding, toggling, editing, and deleting todos).

4. **Strict Mode**: React's Strict Mode is enabled to highlight potential issues in the development process.

## Future Improvements

- **Filter Todos**: Add functionality to filter todos by their completion status (e.g., show only completed or incomplete todos).
- **Persist Todos**: Implement functionality to save todos in local storage or connect to an API to persist the todo list across sessions.
- **Styling Improvements**: Improve the visual design and user experience (UX) with better styling and animations.
